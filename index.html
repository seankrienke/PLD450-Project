        <h1> About this page... </h1>
        Welcome to my Capstone webpage! This is a website built by Sean Krienke in HTML and CSS. This website 
        serves as a reference for a few different cybersecurity topics. The content in this webpage was taken from my 
        Capstone research paper that I've written separately about the given topics. The side bar on the left side of the 
        page will navigate you to each topic, where you can read about each one.

        <h2> What is cybersecurity? </h2>
        When most people think of the field of “cybersecurity”, they often think of dark rooms filled with intricate computer systems and monitors that have seemingly complicated stacks of code on them. They think of genius hackers, secret government operations, and typing furiously at a keyboard to hack into the “mainframe”, thanks to decades of movie portrayals that have given many people a false sense of what cybersecurity really is. The reality is that cybersecurity is so much more than those high-level, secret operations so often shown in the movies. Any way that an internet device or asset is protected can be considered an element of cybersecurity. This includes everything from desktop computers, laptops, smart phones, tablets, and quite literally any device that uses the internet to do a task. There are countless areas within the cybersecurity field that are studied, and some professionals devote their entire careers to specific specialties. This research aims to highly some of the aspects of cybersecurity that are often overlooked. There are countless types of cyber-attacks, defense tactics, and industries that require the security of their cyber systems in order to protect the best interest of the organization and their clients. <br>
