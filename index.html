        <h1> About this page: </h1>
        Welcome to my Capstone webpage! This is a website built by Sean Krienke in HTML and CSS. This website 
        serves as a reference for a few different cybersecurity topics. The content in this webpage was taken from my 
        Capstone research paper that I've written separately about the given topics. The side bar on the left side of the 
        page will navigate you to different topics, where you can read about each one.

        <h2> What is cybersecurity? </h2>
        Cybersecurity is so much more than those high-level, secret operations so often shown in the movies. Any way that an internet device or asset is protected can be considered an element of cybersecurity. This includes everything from desktop computers, laptops, smart phones, tablets, and quite literally any device that uses the internet to do a task. There are countless areas within the cybersecurity field that are studied, and some professionals devote their entire careers to specific specialties. This research aims to highly some of the aspects of cybersecurity that are often overlooked. There are countless types of cyber-attacks, defense tactics, and industries that require the security of their cyber systems in order to protect the best interest of the organization and their clients. The links on the left side of the page will take you to a short summary of why that topic is important in cybersecurity. They are not the only topics, but merely a few out of countless things that make up the evergrowing security field. <br>
