# PLD450 Website Project
Sean Krienke's NAU PLD450 Project 

This project is the final project for my Computer IT program. It's basically a website that I created with HTML and CSS. I used VS Code as the IDE (in this case, just a text editor).
I will be uploading updates to the code as I go through it. I am not collaborating with anyone else on this project, except for internet resources regarding HTML/CSS/JS that 
I'm using as reference.
