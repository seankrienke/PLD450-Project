    <p1>  Cloud computing is becoming increasingly common in business applications. Cloud environments offer scalability and flexibility because they eliminate the hardware that would otherwise be required at the site that it’s being used. An operating system or interface can be emulated through an unrelated computer, which saves money for the organization and makes more tasks possible than if they were not able to access that operating system. Essentially, it is the ability to receive the benefits of various servers and hardware virtually via the internet. However, having this capability can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Breaches in a cloud computing platform can lead to unauthorized access of protected systems and data leaks. The photo below shows a basic outline of how cloud computing works (Milestones, 2021).

        Data sharing within cloud environments is one of the biggest threats in the cloud platform according to a survey done by large corporations that use cloud environments. Many organizations use cloud repositories that are accessible by links, and anyone on the public internet with those links could theoretically access those repositories. Therefore, it’s important to protect those data-sharing points within the cloud from malicious users or people who should not have access. Another threat that exists within the cloud is the threat of account hijacking, which is typically seen when users don’t have strong enough passwords or credentials to protect their accounts. Keeping automated passwords given by the program or emulator can sometimes be a bad idea because criminals can use algorithms to figure out what the password might be. Organizations should prioritize implementing strong access controls, encryption, and regular security audits to protect sensitive data stored in the cloud. Additionally, maintaining a robust incident response plan can help mitigate the impact of potential breaches ("overview").
