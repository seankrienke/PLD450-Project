    The digitalization of critical infrastructure, such as electricity and water supply systems, has brought new cybersecurity challenges. Any disruption to those services could be catastrophic. Nowadays there are existing threats to those systems because they are all connected to the internet in some way. Cyber-attacks happen and can disrupt critical infrastructure. There are generally three major electrical grids in the United States, which are divided up between the west coast, east coast, and Texas. Each of those systems relies on remote access from technical maintainers that access data and controls from computers in off-site locations. In 2022, a study on cyber attacks nationwide showed that the energy industry was the most attacked industry, with over 20% of recorded cyber attacks being directed towards electricity or power companies. The threat against electricity and water stems more from national actors that are working to disrupt American infrastructure. Therefore, the protection of the power grid and water supply has become a priority of the U.S. government (“securing”, 2022).

    Protecting those remote connections requires a multi-layered approach that includes network segmentation, constant monitoring, and regular security assessments. Collaboration between government agencies, utility providers, and cybersecurity experts is crucial to developing and implementing effective strategies to safeguard these services. As it stands now, the electricity and water systems within the United States are the most at risk because of their aging infrastructure and lack of preparation against potential cyber-attacks (Biju, 2023). However, the government has realized this at this point in 2023 and is working on allocating more resources to protecting the citizens’ essential needs.
