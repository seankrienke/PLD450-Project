    One of the biggest cyber threats to the general public exists within the mobile devices that people carry. Mobile devices are now some of the most commonly used technological devices in the world. The majority of adults in the United States use mobile devices and store massive amounts of personal data on them, including banking and personal health information. IoT devices are any household or useful device that connects to the internet, which could include refrigerators, smart thermostats, and even Ring cameras. IoT devices are often poorly secured and vulnerable to exploitation. Individuals and organizations must prioritize mobile device security by regularly updating software, using strong passwords, and being cautious about downloading apps from untrusted sources. Similarly, IoT devices should be secured with unique passwords, regularly updated firmware, and isolated from critical systems to prevent unauthorized access. Fortunately, mobile device attacks have been trending downward since 2020. The pandemic had a massive effect on cyber attacks due to more people being connected to their phones and other devices while staying at home. Apple and other companies have been getting better at securing their devices (Cinar, 2023).
