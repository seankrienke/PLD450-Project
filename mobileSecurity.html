    One of the biggest cyber threats to the general public exists within the mobile devices that people carry. The internet of things, or IoT for short, pertains to the entire interconnected network of devices that use the internet to process data or do a task. An example of this could range from a printer to a heart monitor to a Ring camera. Therefore, anything that uses an internet connection can be manipulated to work against innocent users. <br>

    It's a constant battle for developers to update software and keep it secure against criminal organizations who are always researching how to exploit those devices. One example of a threat against IoT devices is Denial of Service attacks. This is when an attack overwhelms the device's network and can cause the devices(s) to shut down, which could be useful if the attacker wants to disrupt service to an organization. Another threat is the possibility of unauthorized access of those devices. Imagine a hacker being able to look thorough a private camera, or an inside security camera. That poses a significant privacy threat to innocent people. Lastly, some of these devices hold data that could be extremely sensitive. Medical devices hold information about patients or hard data regarding lab values and other things that could be used against somebody if it lands in the wrong hands. That data can be listened to or breached during transmission, which is a large threat to IoT devices in general.
    
    Individuals and organizations must prioritize mobile device security by regularly updating software, using strong encryption methods, and eduacuting the user base on how to safely operate these devices to prevent data from being stolen or exposed to criminal entities. (Cinar, 2023).
