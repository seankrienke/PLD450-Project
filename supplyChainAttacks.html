        Supply chain attacks have gained attention within supply chain industries in recent years because of their ability to cause widespread 
    damage and information leakage. In this type of attack, the attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain by infiltrating vendors 
    or other types of third-party software that the victimized company uses for their supply logistics. One of the consequences of the 
    COVID-19 pandemic was the dramatic increase in criminals trying to exploit supply chain software systems in order to disrupt shipping 
    and steal the information of people involved in the commercial supply chain process. That is because the global supply chain became 
    pressed immediately following the beginning of the pandemic due to many people choosing to order products online instead of going to a 
    store. Within the supply chain relationship in business, there is an implied trust built between the vendor and the business. The company 
    using a supply chain vendor has a certain level of trust in the vendor and gives them privileges to access company information as needed 
    in order to provide the supplies they are paid for. An example of this could be a restaurant contracting with a food vendor, or hospital 
    with medical supplies. There are many other examples of chains of trust in the supply chain industry. Those supply vendors that are trusted 
    typically have less cybersecurity protections within their infrastructure and therefore are easily exploited. That is why supply vendors 
    are exploited by attackers who then use them to gain access to bigger companies, which have more clients to exploit, and more information 
    to use for monetary gain. <br>
    
    <br> To combat this threat, organizations must implement stringent vetting processes for suppliers, conduct regular 
    security audits, and establish clear procedures for reporting potential vulnerabilities with software systems. According to a study done on 
    supply chain attacks, over 422 million people in the world in 2022 were exploited via supply chain software breaches. The information that 
    was leaked ranged from names to addresses, bank account numbers, and medical record numbers. This dramatic increase was largely blamed on 
    the Russia-Ukraine war, due to Russian cybercriminals taking advantage of the distraction of the war to focus more on cyber crime and 
    exploit supply trade software used globally.
